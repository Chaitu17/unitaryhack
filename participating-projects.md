## [Mitiq](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq)

Mitiq is a Python toolkit for implementing error mitigation techniques on quantum computers.

Current quantum computers are noisy due to interactions with the environment, imperfect gate applications, state preparation and measurement errors, etc. Error mitigation seeks to reduce these effects at the software level by compiling quantum programs in clever ways.

## [toqito](https://github.com/vprusso/toqito)

The toqito package is an open source Python library for studying various
objects in quantum information, namely, states, channels, and measurements.

Specifically, toqito focuses on providing numerical tools to study problems
pertaining to entanglement theory, nonlocal games, matrix analysis, and other
aspects of quantum information that are often associated with computer science.

## [Interlin-q](https://github.com/Interlin-q/Interlin-q)

Interlin-q is a simulation platform for simulating distributed quantum algorithms. The purpose
of Interlin-q is to be able to enter a monolithic quantum circuit and based on the distributed
architecture, automatically map the circuit and then simulate the control process to run the algorithm.

## [Qrack](https://github.com/vm6502q/qrack)

Qrack is a GPU-accelerated HPC quantum computer simulator framework. The core library is
dependency-free C++11, with optional OpenCL and Boost headers. Hardware supports spans from desktop,
to mobile, to distributed clusters, and OS support includes Linux, Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS.
Qrack aims to optimize the performance of noiseless pure state simulations. To this end, it contains
many "layers" of functionality and novel optimization techniques.
