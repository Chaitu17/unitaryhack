## [Mitiq](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq)

Mitiq is a Python toolkit for implementing error mitigation techniques on quantum computers.

Current quantum computers are noisy due to interactions with the environment, imperfect gate applications, state preparation and measurement errors, etc. Error mitigation seeks to reduce these effects at the software level by compiling quantum programs in clever ways.

## [toqito](https://github.com/vprusso/toqito)

The toqito package is an open source Python library for studying various
objects in quantum information, namely, states, channels, and measurements.

Specifically, toqito focuses on providing numerical tools to study problems
pertaining to entanglement theory, nonlocal games, matrix analysis, and other
aspects of quantum information that are often associated with computer science.
