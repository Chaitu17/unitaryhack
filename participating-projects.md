# UnitaryHACK particiapting projects:

Looking for a great quantum open source project to hack?
This list is all the projects participating in UnitaryHACK

## [Mitiq](https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq)

Mitiq is a Python toolkit for implementing error mitigation techniques on quantum computers.

Current quantum computers are noisy due to interactions with the environment, imperfect gate applications, state preparation and measurement errors, etc. Error mitigation seeks to reduce these effects at the software level by compiling quantum programs in clever ways.
