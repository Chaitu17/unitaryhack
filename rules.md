# Rules

1. unitaryHACK is open to everyone in our global community. Whether youâ€™re a seasoned contributor or looking for quantum projects to contribute to for the first time, please **[sign up here](https://7r2lxl70pvl.typeform.com/to/HfJLX5fl)** so we know to look for your contributions! There are some limitations about where we can ship physical swag, see the [Terms and Conditions](#terms-and-conditions) below.
2. A contribution to a participating project for this hackathon consists of making a pull request yourself to the project's repository. You can find a list of participating quantum open source projects [here](./participating-projects.md), and a [list of all the issues with bounties](TODO). For pull requests that have a bounty, the first accepted PR from the project maintainers will receive the prize, so make sure the contact info you sign-up for the contest with is correct!
3. Hackers can make contributions anytime between May 14th and May 30th. Just be sure to [sign up here](https://7r2lxl70pvl.typeform.com/to/HfJLX5fl) and make sure that you put `[unitaryHACK]` in the title of your PR so the bots can find your contributions and make sure you get credit! You can look for open issues on GitHub labeled #unitaryhack for inspiration. Quality contributions are encouraged, see some discussion of what makes a good pull request from the [Hacktoberfest guidelines](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details#quality).
4. All participants and maintainers must adhere to the project's Code of Conduct as well as the Unitary Fund [Community Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

If you have any questions about the event or want to get in touch with others working on the event, join our [Discord](https://discord.unitary.fund)! We will also be featuring some of the best contributions from the hackathon on our [Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/unitaryfund) after the event.
