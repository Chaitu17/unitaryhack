# UnitaryHACK 2021, April 16-30

Quantum computing isn’t just unitary, it’s open source!

The Unitary Fund is proud to host our first quantum open source hackathon with ｓｗａｇ and 【﻿ｂｏｕｎｔｉｅｓ】!

We have:
-  $2K USD in bounties for tagged issues in quantum open source projects, and 
-  the first 25 participants that make 1 quality Pull Request that gets accepted to a participating open source project will receive a swag pack in the mail!

## Rules for the Hackathon

1. UnitaryHACK is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you’re a seasoned contributor or looking for quantum projects to contribute to for the first time, you’re welcome to **participate by signing up [here](TODO)*** so we know to look for your contributions. There are some limitations about where we can ship actual swag, see the [Terms and Conditions](#terms-and-conditions) below.   
2. A contribution to a participating project for this hackathon consists of making a pull request yourself to the project's repository. You can find a list of participating quantum open source projects [here](./participating-projects.md), and a [list of all the issues with bounties](TODO). For pull requests that address an issue that has a bounty, the first accepted PR from the project maintainers will receive the prize, so make sure the contact info you sign-up for the contest with is correct!
3. Hackers can make contributions anytime between April 16th and April 30th. Just be sure to [sign up here](TODO) and tag your pull requests with #UnitaryHACK for your pull requests to count. You can look for open issues on GitHub labeled UnitaryHACK for inspiration. Quality contributions are encouraged, see some discussion of what makes a good pull request from the [Hacktoberfest guidelines](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details#quality).
4. All participants and maintainers must adhere to the project's Code of Conduct as well as the Unitary Fund [Community Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
