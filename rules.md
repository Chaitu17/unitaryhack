Quantum computing isn’t just unitary, it’s open source!

The Unitary Fund is proud to host our first quantum open source hackathon with SWAG and BOUNTIES!

[$2K] in bounties for tagged issues in quantum open source projects
First [25] participants that make 1 quality Pull Request (PR)s to a participating open source project will receive a swag pack in the mail!*

## Rules for the Hackathon

- $UNITARYHACK is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you’re a seasoned contributor or looking for quantum projects to contribute to for the first time, you’re welcome to participate.
- Pull requests can be made in any GitHub-hosted repository of a participating project. You can find a list of participating quantum open source projects [here], and a list of all the issues with bounties [here]. For pull requests that address an issue that has a bounty, the first accepted PR from the project maintainers will get the prize.
- You can make contributions anytime between April 16th and April 30th. Just be sure to [sign up here] and tag your pull requests with #unitaryhack for your pull requests to count. You can look for open issues labeled #unitaryhack for inspiration. Quality contributions are encouraged! 

If you have any questions about the event or want to get in touch with others working on the event, join our [discord]! We will also be featuring some of the bounty winners on our twitch channel after the event.
