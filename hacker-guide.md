# UnitaryHACKer Guide

No matter your experience in quantum tech or open source communities, **you** can help make quantum open source better (and get PRIZES!)

This guide will help you understand more about the event and how you can make the most of it!

## Before the Hack

### Brush up on your open source contribution skills:

- https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions

### Review the tech
Whether you are new to quantum technologies or work on them every day, here is a good list of general quantum computing resources that might be helpful to learn with or brush up on:

- [The Qiskit Textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html)
- [Overview talk on Quantum Computing / PyQuil and Forest](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/11929-programming-the-world-s-first-quantum-computers-using-forest)
- [Quantum Machine Learning / Pennylane Tutorials](https://pennylane.ai/qml/)
- [Quantum Software Talks](https://unitary.fund/talks.html) from Unitary Fund

### Dig into the docs

If there is a project from the [particiapting projects]() that you think you want to work on, go through their docs and see if you can setup a project with the tool/software on your computer. If you have trouble with that then you can ask questions either by filing issues on the project repo, or on the #help-me channel on the [Unitary Fund discord]().

## During the Hack

The main thing that will be most helpful to you while you hack is connecting with other hackers and maintainers on the discord.
