# UnitaryHACKer Guide

No matter your experience in quantum tech or open source communities, **you** can help make quantum open source better (and get PRIZES!)

This guide will help you understand more about the event and how you can make the most of it!

## Before the Hack

### Brush up on your open source contribution skills

- [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/)
- [GitHub Training Kit](https://training.github.com/)
- [Understanding the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
- [How open source contributions can boost your career](https://opensource.com/article/19/5/how-get-job-doing-open-source)
- [How to write the perfect pull request](https://github.blog/2015-01-21-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request/)
- [How to write a good commit message](https://dev.to/chrissiemhrk/git-commit-message-5e21)
- [Practice making a GitHub Contribution](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions)

### Review the tech

Whether you are new to quantum technologies or work on them every day, here is a good list of general quantum computing resources that might be helpful to learn with or brush up on:

- [Quantum Open Source Learning Resources on Quantum Computing](https://qosf.org/learn_quantum/)
- [Quantum Software Talks by Unitary Fund](https://unitary.fund/talks.html)
- [The Qiskit Textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html)
- [Overview talk on Quantum Computing / PyQuil and Forest](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/11929-programming-the-world-s-first-quantum-computers-using-forest)
- [Quantum Machine Learning / Pennylane Tutorials](https://pennylane.ai/qml/)

### Dig into the docs

If there is a project from the [participating projects](./participating-projects.md) that you think you want to work on, go through their docs and see if you can setup a project with the tool/software on your computer. If you have trouble with that then you can ask questions either by filing issues on the project repo, or on the #help-me channel on the [Unitary Fund discord](https://discord.unitary.fund).

## During the Hack

The main place that will be most helpful to you while you hack is connecting with other hackers and maintainers on the [Unitary Fund discord](https://discord.unitary.fund).
You can find folks from both Unitary Fund to ask about rules, maintainers of the participating projects, as well as other hackers who might be able to lend a hand!

**Once you are ready to make a pull request, make sure that you put `[unitaryHACK]` in the title of your PR so the bots can find your contributions and make sure you get credit!**

## After the Hack

Show off your digital or IRL swag and check out what everyone else has done on the Discord, Twitter, GitHub!
