# Quantum open source maintainers:

The Unitary Fund would like to invite you to participate in our first quantum open source hackathon!

TODO: Make a pitch for why this is an event they want to participate in

The rules for the event are [here](./rules.md), but the ways in which we are looking for your help are:

## Before the event:
Tag issues on your projects you would like people to take a look at (unitaryhack)
Identify if there are any issues you want to put a bounty on to encourage participants to tackle them. Our goal is to have approximately one issue per project, and we can scale that based on the size of your projectâ€™s codebase.

## During the event:
Hopefully you should be getting helpful PRs! We will compensate you for your time reviewing these PRs at [rate TBD] if that can help support the project.
If a PR does not meet a minimum bar for quality, or if another PR has been accepted, please communicate on the PR conversation that it is not accepted. you can tag it with rejected.
For bountied issues, mark the PR you want it awarded to with unitaryhack-accepted and we will take care of sending out the bounty!
If a PR does not meet a minimum bar for quality, or if another PR has been accepted, please communicate on the PR conversation that it is not accepted. you can tag it with rejected.
If you want a way to chat more synchronously with folks working on PRs we will be hosting hackerspaces on our discord channels for people to hangout and work on the hackathon together!

## How to choose good issues:

TBD
